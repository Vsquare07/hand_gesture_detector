This project uses the predictions made by mediapipe's hand landmarks to predict whether you are showing like(thumbs up) or dislike(thumbs down). However I failed to make the model predict if the gesture is neither Like nor Dislike...

The live camera feed is provided by opencv library

I used <a href="https://github.com/hukenovs/hagrid/tree/master">Hagrid data set</a> to train the model
